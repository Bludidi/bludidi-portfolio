        I am currently enrolled at Microverse, a remote software development
        school that utilizes pair programming and real-world projects to teach
        students. Starting programming as a hobby in 2021, my passion for it
        quickly grew, leading me to seek a professional platform for learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite having a non-programming background, I leveraged my past skills
        in time management, communication, planning, organization, and attention
        to detail to facilitate smooth learning and adaptation. Throughout the
        curriculum, I have constructed numerous web applications using
        JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. My GitHub showcases
        these projects in detail.
        <br />
        <br />
        Alongside technical skills, I have honed collaboration, remote work best
        practices, teamwork, project development, and pair programming
        abilities. A mindset of continuous learning enables me to navigate the
        ever-changing technological landscape, fostering ongoing growth.
        Certified in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React & Redux, Ruby and Databases,
        Ruby on Rails, and Full Stack Capstone, I distinguish myself through my
        proactive adherence to ethics and best practices, dynamic team
        collaboration with accountability, willingness to learn and adapt, and
        ability to tackle complex problems outside my comfort zone.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am open to opportunities, collaborations, or projects where my
        skills and expertise can contribute to organizational success. Please
